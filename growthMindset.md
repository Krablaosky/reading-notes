# Growth Mindset and what it Means

A growth Mindset is the ability to believe **that you _can_ change**. This comes in handy when thinking about *challenges* that you might face in everyday. When facing these challenges you can either believe that you will be stuck the way you are ***Forever*** or you can believe that you have the ability to **Grow**. It can be so easy to just throw your hands up and say >*I'm just never going to be able to do this*. Well of course things won't be different with that mentality. Things won't change if there is no room for change, and the belief that we can change is what a growth mindset is all about. Being in a **Growth Mindset** is crucial to solving problems and developing our critical thinking skills. 

When we are stuck there are a few helpful reminders for staying in that mindset.


#### 3 Reminders to stay in a Growth Mindset
- [ ] *The first thing* is that you are going to be *bad* at this, it's your first time doing this, cut yourself some slack.
- [ ] *The second thing* Is that this is not forever. You will be able to look back and recognize how much progress you've made.
- [ ] ***The most important thing*** is to remember that you are not alone. Everyone is going through this with you. :tada:
