# A Reflection on Github Markdown

Learning about ho to use *Github Markdown* is surprisingly easier than you would think.
It's extremely important to slow down and make sure that you have spent some time on the layout and design of your webpage layout so that you don't end up with a jumbled mess.
While Github Pages makes creating a simple website easy, the urge to just go full force is strong but will lead you astray. Using **Markdown** is a key part in this and will make building a website easier. Instead of having to hand build *Margins* and designing each element *from scratch*, using Github Pages and *Markdown* makes it so much easier. The language is simple to understand and extremely basic while being interactive and involved.

I would reccomend following the below order for getting started.
1. Draw a draft design
2. Fill out the content
3. Use [**Basic Writing and Formatting**](https://docs.github.com/en/get-started/writing-on-github/getting-started-with-writing-and-formatting-on-github/basic-writing-and-formatting-syntax#styling-text) to stylize it and bring it to life. 


#### For Instance
All of the above text has been formatted using *Markdown*
A series of different symbols builds the style and brings it to life.
