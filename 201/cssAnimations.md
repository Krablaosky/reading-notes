1. What does a CSS transform allow the developer to do to an element?

Using `transform` in CSS allows a lot of really cool functionality with CSS. It allows you to alter the size, rotation, position or adjust things in a 2d or 3d way. This really allows a lot of cool animations to be integrated with websites and can make them really pop.

CSS Transitions & Animations

For transforming elements the 2d elements that can be used are things like rotate, which allow you to either shift an objects standard rotation or even in a 3d sense rotate that object. There is also scale which allows you to enlarge or shrink an object. If you translate an object you move it's position around on the screen in either the x or y axis. You can also do things like `Skew` items to adjust the distance between corners to make these objects look like they are slanted.

## CSS Transitions and Animations

1. What does a CSS transition allow the developer to do to an element?

CSS Transition allows the developer to have an element change from one static state to another over a course of time. So instead of a button color just changing from green to red it will slowly change if you set the transition time to something like 5s. Which means it will take 5 seconds for the computer to change that button from green to red.


2. How does a CSS animation differ from a CSS transition?

Animations are more complex than transitions are. Where transitions can only shift between two states animations allow for a lot of transitions and complex interactions.. Think abut an animation of a ball bouncing across the screen, it would take too many transitions that would need to be linked, and thats exactly what animations do.
