# HTML, CSS, & JS continued

## HTML

1. Why is it important to use semantic elements in our HTML?

It is important to use semantic elements in our HTML because it helps us to clearly understand the code that we are using. If we had a bit of code called `getNumber()` that really gave out favorite flavors of ice cream then it wouldn't really be helpful would it. A function called `iceCreamFlavor()` would be more appropriately named. We can also use some semantic elements in our HTML to easily use preset parts for building our HTML. Take the `<h1>` element, this is a predefined header element that clearly explains what we want.

2. How many levels of headings are there in HTML?

There are six heading elements that we can use to change the size of our headings. `<h1>` through `<h6>` actually get smaller as the numbers get bigger. Imagine `h1` is the #1 heading and `h6` is the 6th place heading.

3. What are some uses for the `<sup>` and `<sub>` elements?

 `<sup>` and `<sub>` stand for Superscript and Subscript accordingly. We would want to use these for things like math equations or dates or basically anything that needs text to be above or below the main text line. The Superscript `<sup></sup>` will put the text above the main line while the Subscript `<sub></sub>` will put the text below. 

 For example: My birthday is on the 25<sup>th</sup> of some<sub>random</sub> month.

 actually looks like `My birthday is on the 25<sup>th</sup> of some<sub>random</sub> month.`

4. When using the `<abbr>` element, what attribute must be added to provide the full expansion of the term?

When using the `<abbr>` element we would want to use the `title` attribute to show the full expansion of the text.

If we had the line `<p> Don't talk to <abbr title = "Reverend"> Rev.</abbr>  about this stuff.</p>`

it would look like

<p> Don't talk to <abbr title = "Reverend"> Rev.</abbr>  about this stuff.</p>
