# My views on **Text Editors**

## What is a Text Editor?

A text editor is a simple piece of software that you can access that allows you to write and manage text. 
You can use it for a variety of things and have probably used one today. Things from Word to Google Sheets and Notepad are all text editors. 
You can also write code in a text editor. Would you really want to do that though? Someone might be interested in the no frills version of a text editor.
Let's be real though, we are living in an incredibly advanced time and things like text editors for coding have evolved.

There are a lot of third party options that create beautiful text editors that have a lot of advanced features to make Coding easy. 
Choosing a text editor is like choosing a car to drive. They all get you from A to B but some people want to have their car drive them offroad and some people want their car to be more gas efficient. Some people like to drive Ferrari's and honestly they all get you where you are going.
