# Wireframe & Design

### What is a wireframe? 
A wireframe is a low-tech design of how a website app is going to look. You want to make sure that you can understand the layout before you start building the bones of your website. You can either use a pen-and-paper approach or a digital approach to take care of this.

 Remember to keep this part simple and keep the shapes simple. This is a great way to share with a team and have them add anything more in-depth as you progress along.

### How to start

1. Do some research
   * Check out website and app examples to find out what looks good and what doesn't, sometimes simple is the best and you will start to see overengineered websites and clunky UX

2. Draw it out
   * Get a good sketch of what you think it should look like. Then probably re-work it at least 10 times.

3. Move to Online
   * Now that you've got the basic idea down put it in a sharable wireframe editor. We will cover this in depth later.

4. Flowchart it
   * Draw out the flowchart for users to make sure it all goes smoothly. Donâ€™t get int he weeds

5. Detail it
   *Get into the nitty gritty details of how it should look and feel, then get testing on simple segments, work it through piece by piece

6. Start turning into prototypes
   * Test your website section by section to understand how each page works and if there are any glaring issues before you get to assembling all the pages.

7. Get testers
   * You are sure that everything works, awesome! Now ask some friends to test it once you and see if they can break it. That's how you are going to improve it.
