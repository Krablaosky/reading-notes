# Diversity & Inclusion in the Tech Industry

## Consider the history: [That Time When Women Stopped Coding](https://www.npr.org/sections/money/2014/10/21/357629765/when-women-stopped-coding)

1. What occurred during the same time as the beginning of the decline of women in computer science?

There was a heavy amount of gender bias that was portrayed in the media that placed men at the center of the computer technology industry. These movies and pieces of entertainment help dictate the male gender dominated field and that computers were for people raised male.

2. Why does it matter that males had been playing on computers growing up?

It matters because it sets early growth and adaption into the field. Once kids grow up with technology and computers they define the field and what the standards are. It also sets the tone for how people will be encouraged to be in that field and then have to fight to gain a seat at the table as opposed to the people who grew up with access.

1. When are diversity efforts most successful?

diversity efforts are most successful when they are driven by commitments from company leaders. Leaders need to commit to diversity for the efforts to stick and work.

2. Why do diverse companies perform better?

Diversity brings multiple points of view to problems and allows people who think differently and have different perspectives on challenges. It really broadens the scope of the way people think and tackle new challenges.

3. Give an example of how a diverse company can serve a diverse user base or vise-versa.

having a more diverse company can better represent their users and their users diversity. It adds a personal aspect of creating a more inclusive goods and services that work to the broader population. There is the ability to engage better with all populations instead of excluding them.
