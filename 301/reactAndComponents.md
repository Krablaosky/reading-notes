# Introduction to React and Components


## Component-Based Architecture

1. What is a “component”?

A component is a tiny modular and customizable section of code that can be easily modified in one space to affect multiple locations that it's linked to.It heavily relies on the concept of inheritance and allows a lot of component reusability code reusability

2. What are the characteristics of a component?

Characteristics of components are that they are are easily reusable sets of code that is very clear straightforward and easy to use. the biggest bit of functionality for them is that they are intended to be reusable and self deployable.It's important to help reduce time in developmentAnd centralize code to be able to make fewer edits to a larger base

3. What are the advantages of using component-based architecture?

some of the advantages of using component based architectureI that the system's broken up into individual sections of reusable and adaptable code that can be easily manipulated and impact a larger scale. some additional advantages about it is easy to deploy and modify code as well as replace existing versions with little impact to additional sections of code. System reliability is often increased when we use component based architecture and it's easy to maintain and update systems in a very hyper focused way without impacting the entire site

### What is Props and How to Use it in React

1. What is “props” short for?

Props is short for properties

2. How are props used in React?

Props are often used for passing data from one component to another

3. What is the flow of props?

Props flow in three steps.First we have to define an attribute and then the value or data that is associated with. After that we pass it to the child components using the props keyword. finally we render the props data and allow it to be seen in the parent component. Props data can only be passed to components from parent to child And that data is immutable or read only
