# Reading Thoughts So Far

## Git vs Github

The concept of GitHub vs Git is a funny and interesting thing. Git is like the word processor that you can type out a document and get it all working, whereas GitHub is like turning it into Google Drive where all of the simultaneous multifunctionality can exist at the same time.

Knowing this is extremely important when it comes to collaboration and how we can work together. It can be a huge tool for large teams working together on different tasks to take a slice of the pie and make their own edits. Ideally this should be done in an independent text editor like **VS Code** and then uploaded to GitHub.

Working in this way will help with keeping version history neat and tidy along with accountability for changes. There is a potential for error though if GitHub and VS Code both have conflicting information. Ubuntu will at least ask if we would like to merge these things together.

Being able to work in VS Code allows for much more customization out of GitHub Pages and the ability to customize your console exactly the way you want.
