## About Me

My name is Nick Mullaney, I'm a chef and worked in high end foodservice for 17 years, most notably a Chef at **Google**. I have always loved technology and building computers to troubleshooting every problem, so coding seemed like the next logical step in my journey. I am super fascinated with what coding can do and just like Culinary it has a beautiful art to it and can be extremely creative.
My wife and I have 2 cats and I am engaged in a never ending list of hobbies and nerddoms. Quite frequently this is the state of my brain.
