# Reading Thoughts So Far

## Git vs Github

The concept of GitHub vs Git is a funny and interesting thing, it seems like they would be the same thing but they are definitely not. Git is like word on your computer, where you keep saving that latest version of your resume. GitHub is like turning it into a super tool where all versions of the resume exist at the same time and can be accessed.

Knowing this is extremely important when it comes to collaboration and how we can work together. It can be a huge tool for large teams working together on different tasks to take a slice of the pie and make their own edits. Ideally this should be done in an independent text editor like **VS Code** and then uploaded to GitHub. This would be extremely useful in case there was a central database corruption and the repository was lost. Each user might have a portion of that repository on their PC's and be able to recover it, bit by bit.

Working in this way will help with keeping version history neat and tidy along with accountability for changes. There is a potential for error though if GitHub and VS Code both have conflicting information. Ubuntu will at least ask if we would like to merge these things together.

Being able to work in VS Code allows for much more customization out of GitHub Pages and the ability to customize your console exactly the way you want.
