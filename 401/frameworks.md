## Next.js:

Two things about Next.js:

1. Server-Side Rendering (SSR): Next.js provides built-in support for server-side rendering. This means that pages are pre-rendered on the server, allowing faster initial loading and improved search engine optimization (SEO). Next.js automatically handles the server-side rendering, making it easier to create dynamic and optimized web applications.

2. File-Based Routing: Next.js follows a file-based routing system. By placing components inside the `pages` directory, Next.js automatically generates routes based on the file structure. This eliminates the need to set up manual routing and simplifies the organization of the application code. For example, a file named `about.js` inside the `pages` directory will automatically create a route for `/about`.

## Gatsby.js:

Two things about Gatsby.js:

1. Static Site Generator (SSG): Gatsby.js is primarily known as a static site generator. It allows developers to build high-performance websites by generating static HTML, CSS, and JavaScript files during the build process. This results in faster load times, improved security, and better SEO. Gatsby.js leverages React for building dynamic components while still generating static assets for improved performance.

2. GraphQL Integration: Gatsby.js integrates seamlessly with GraphQL, a query language for APIs. It enables developers to fetch data from multiple sources and transform it into the required format for their website. Gatsby.js uses GraphQL to efficiently retrieve and manage data, making it easy to query content from various backends like CMS platforms, APIs, and databases. This integration simplifies data fetching and enables flexible content management.
