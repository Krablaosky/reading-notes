# Component Lifecycle / useEffect Hook

### [useEffect hook](https://react.dev/reference/react/useEffect#reference)

1. What is the main intended use case for the useEffect hook?
   * The main intended use case for the `useEffect` hook is to handle side effects in functional components. Side effects refer to any actions that are performed by a component that have effects outside of the component itself, such as fetching data from an API, subscribing to event listeners, manipulating the DOM, or updating document titles. The `useEffect` hook allows you to perform these side effects in a controlled and declarative way within a functional component.


2. How does the effect’s logic interact with the component?
   * The effect's logic interacts with the component by running after the initial render and after every update (re-render) of the component. When you define an effect using the `useEffect` hook, you pass a callback function as the first argument. This callback function contains the side effect logic. The effect is executed immediately after the component has rendered for the first time, and subsequently after each update. The effect's logic can interact with the component by accessing its state, props, or other variables, and it can perform actions like modifying the state, making API requests, subscribing/unsubscribing to event listeners, and more.

3. What is the importance of the return value from the effect’s logic function?
   * The return value from the effect's logic function has an important role in the `useEffect` hook. This return value is used to clean up the effect or perform additional actions when the component unmounts or before the effect is re-run. If the effect needs to perform any cleanup, such as cancelling subscriptions or removing event listeners, you can return a cleanup function from the effect's logic function. This cleanup function will be executed when the component unmounts or before the effect is re-run. Additionally, if the effect depends on certain values or props, returning a function that handles the cleanup helps to ensure that the cleanup is performed properly when those dependencies change or the component unmounts.
