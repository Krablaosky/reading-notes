## Ideas for projects

1. D&D Character Manager: Create a web application for managing D&D characters. Users can create accounts, log in, and create and manage their characters with various attributes and abilities. The application can include features such as character creation, leveling up, inventory management, spell tracking etc. Implement authentication and authorization to ensure that users can only access and modify their own characters. We can integrate with the D&D API or use a custom database to retrieve information about spells, monsters, and items to enhance the character management experience.

2. Movie Recommendation System: Build a movie recommendation system that suggests movies to users based on their preferences or list of movies they stored and said they wanted to watch. Users can create accounts, log in, and provide their movie preferences (genres, actors, directors, etc.). The system can use content-based filtering to analyze user preferences and recommend movies that match their interests. It could, integrate with a movie database API to fetch movie details, ratings, and reviews. Users can also rate and review movies they have watched. Implement authentication and authorization to ensure personalized recommendations for each user.
