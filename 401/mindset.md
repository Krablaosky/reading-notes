## [Upgrade Your Technical Skills with Deliberate Practice](https://web.archive.org/web/20160616225417/http://www.happybearsoftware.com/upgrade-your-technical-skills-with-deliberate-practice)

The article discusses the importance of deliberate practice in improving hard technical skills in software development. Deliberate practice is performing activities designed to effectively improve specific aspects of performance, which pushes you just outside your comfort zone, is repeated often, and provides continuous feedback.

Software developers should set themselves challenges that meet these criteria to continuously improve their skills and avoid stalling out in stagnation. The challenges should challenge the gaps in knowledge and repeated often to apply the new technique or skill in different situations. The feedback on the correctness of solutions is readily available for technical problems, but feedback on more subjective measures, such as how well-organized the code is or how secure it is, can be more challenging to obtain.

It is important for developers to learn new technical skills by applying existing skills to real-world problems. It's important to encourage developers to step out of their comfort zones and set themselves small, finishable challenges to learn something new.

## Growth Mindset

Having a growth mindset means believing in the potential for development through effort and learning. It entails viewing challenges as opportunities for growth and learning, rather than as threats to one's abilities. Redefining success involves shifting the focus from external validation to internal fulfillment by setting meaningful and challenging personal goals and focusing on personal growth. Combining a growth mindset and redefining success can help cultivate resilience, perseverance, and self-awareness. By embracing challenges, learning from mistakes, and defining success on their own terms, individuals can foster a sense of purpose and fulfillment in their lives.

## Emotional Intelligence

I re-took the Emotional intelligence assessment and came up with relatively close to 20s in all categories. a lot of this is because I spend a lot of time reflecting on what I'm doing and how I'm interacting with different people. I also have been doing a lot of emotional healing to be more aware of my own feelings at given times,I've always had an ability for empathy and relationship management So I'm not surprised that those were some of my highest areas. The big one for me to work on is self management, and that's someone who has ADHD, that is always been a challenge for me and will continue to be a challenge for me. i've continually come up with new ways to help myself in the process and ways to work with it, but I'm not always successful.

## Assessing Bias

When I took this I learned that my what is bias and bias and identity are my highest areas where I feel the most comfortable and confident in, predominantly understanding and respecting other people's identities and life challenges that they may have gone through.The area that is the weakest for Maine is the four ways to act. A lotHas to do with what I'm doing in terms of caring for myself, learning how to seek out new opportunities, and especially giving back to the community. those are all things that I really feel I can work on continually, I really place value on these but have a hard time committing and engaging with it consistently. I think that this turned out as I expected, I've been doing a lot of work to be aware and mindful of courage and how to mitigate bias, and I'm planning to find resources to aid with that so that I can continually grow.
